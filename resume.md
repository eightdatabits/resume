### Work Experience

---

**Cognitive Anteater Robotics Laboratory, University of California Irvine**
Senior Development Engineer, February 2010 - Present

* Designed, built, and maintained robots and electronics used for computational neuroscience research.

* Worked with graduate students and faculty to meet their research needs.

* Tracked and maintained parts inventory, purchase orders, reimbursements, and component and part libraries.

* Took on the role of system administrator of the lab server, including maintaining Subversion (SVN), MediaWiki, and Bugzilla installations, granting user access, and installing updates and fixes.

* Designed custom mechanical components and assemblies using Solidworks CAD software. Components and assemblies were specified in drawings for precision machining or hand built for one-off testing and prototyping.

* Designed custom printed circuit boards (PCBs) and built and/or ordered printed circuit assemblies (PCAs). Boards used both through-hole and surface mount components where appropriate and met size, cost, and functional specifications for each given project.

* Programmed and tested firmware for 8-bit and 16-bit PIC microcontrollers, including code for motor control, sensor integration (e.g. compass, IR distance sensors, quadrature encoders, etc.), and communication (e.g. SPI, UART, and CAN bus). 

* Programmed and tested software for Windows, Mac, and Linux PCs which interfaced with both custom and off-the-shelf hardware to control and communicate with it. Used mainly C and C++ (including Qt libraries for event driven and GUI applications).

* Built, installed, and maintained custom embedded Linux installations (including Angstrom, Ubuntu, and Arch distributions).

* Gave quarterly presentations to the lab both on the current status of on-going projects as well as a range of research subjects including the current state of the art in the fields of neuroscience, computer science, and robotics.

* Collaborated with other lab members to solve a range of problems and brainstorm new concepts for robots and research avenues.
