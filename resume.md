### Education
-------------

**Carnegie Mellon University** - Pittsburg, PA<br />
Bachelor of Science, Mechanical Engineering, 2003-2007

**University of California, Irvine (Extension)** - Irvine, CA<br />
Certificate Program, Embedded Systems Engineering, 2011-2012

### Work Experience
-------------------

**Cognitive Anteater Robotics Laboratory, University of California Irvine** - Irvine, CA<br />
Senior Development Engineer, February 2010 - Present

* Designed, built, and maintained robots and electronics used for computational neuroscience research.
* Worked with graduate students and faculty to meet their research needs.
* Tracked and maintained parts inventory, purchase orders, reimbursements, and component and part libraries.
* Took on the role of system administrator of the lab server, including maintaining Subversion (SVN), MediaWiki, and Bugzilla installations, granting user access, and installing updates and fixes.
* Designed custom mechanical components and assemblies using Solidworks CAD software. Components and assemblies were specified in drawings for precision machining or hand built for one-off testing and prototyping.
* Designed custom printed circuit boards (PCBs) and built and/or ordered printed circuit assemblies (PCAs). Boards used both through-hole and surface mount components where appropriate and met size, cost, and functional specifications for each given project.
* Programmed and tested firmware for 8-bit and 16-bit PIC microcontrollers, including code for motor control, sensor integration (e.g. compass, IR distance sensors, quadrature encoders, etc.), and communication (e.g. SPI, UART, and CAN bus). 
* Programmed and tested software for Windows, Mac, and Linux PCs which interfaced with both custom and off-the-shelf hardware to control and communicate with it. Used mainly C and C++ (including Qt libraries for event driven and GUI applications).
* Built, installed, and maintained custom embedded Linux installations (including Angstrom, Ubuntu, and Arch distributions).
* Gave quarterly presentations to the lab both on the current status of on-going projects as well as a range of research subjects including the current state of the art in the fields of neuroscience, computer science, and robotics.
* Collaborated with other lab members to solve a range of problems and brainstorm new concepts for robots and research avenues.

**WET Design** - Sun Valley, CA<br />
Product Engineer, January 2008 - June 2009

* Worked closely with a team to take products for architectural fountains from concept to installation, including the Burj Dubai and the City Center in Las Vegas.
* Purchased or engineered parts to make the most cost effective use of production capabilities including water jet, laser, punch press, press brake, lathe and mill, and welding.
* Engineered many aspects of the Oarsman, Ribbon Nozzle, and analog nozzle, including bearings, high tolerance parts, sheet metal bends, welding fixtures, castings, and linkages.
* Engineered devices for harsh environments such as brominated, chlorinated and salt water, dirty or sandy water, and water up to 120 deg F.
* Worked with vendors and suppliers to get part specifications and lead times.

**Carnegie Mellon Institute for Complex Engineered Systems** - Pittsburgh, PA<br />
Research Assistant, Summer 2006

* Developed algorithms to analyze abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) and generate 3D models of the aneurysms for stent design and customization.
* Used MATLABs image processing toolbox to manipulate and segment CT scans.
* Designed and programmed user interfaces in MATLAB for ease of use and automatic processing of images.
* Experimented with MATLAB Neural Network toolbox.
* Created 3D models for import into Fluent for fluid flow analysis.
* Worked in a team to develop and refine code, manage projects, and build a wiki to serve as program manual and provide code.

**Good Vibrations Auto Salon** - Horsham, PA<br />
Electronics Installer, Summer 2004

* Designed, built, and installed custom high-end automotive audio/video systems, and performance components to suit customers' needs.
* Installed Pennsylvania court-mandated DUI Breathalyzers and processed paperwork to ensure full compliance with state requirements.

**Santilli's Automotive Transmission Specialists** - Glenside, PA<br />
Mechanic's Assistant, Summer 2003
* Assisted mechanics in installation of new transmissions and clutches.
* Assisted mechanics or worked individually to repair general automotive issues.

**East Coast Automotive Machining** - Glenside, PA<br />
Machinist's Assistant, Spring 2003
* Disassembled engines and machined valves.
* Glass-beaded and prepared parts for machining.
